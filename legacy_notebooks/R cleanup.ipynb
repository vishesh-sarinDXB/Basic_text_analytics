Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</td></tr>\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </span></td></tr>\n",

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\\\\\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;***** |\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente).

The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

       "2 *****<br />Numi's Collection Assortment Melange includes:<br />5 Herbal Teas (caffeine-free, also called \"\"teasans\"\"):<br />* Dry Desert Lime: Lime Herbal Teasan<br />* Fields of Gold: Lemongrass Herbal Teasan<br />* Red Mellow Bush: Rooibos Herbal Teasan<br />* Bushmen's Brew: Honeybush Herbal Teasan<br />* Simply Mint: Moroccan Mint<br /><br />2 Green Teas (lower in caffeine):<br />* Temple of Heaven: Gunpowder Green Tea<br />* Monkey King: Jasmine Green Tea<br /><br />2 Black Teas (contain caffeine):<br />* Chinese Breakfast: Yunnan Black Tea<br />* Smoky Tarry: Lapsang Souchong Black Tea<br /><br />This is a total of nine different teas, two tea bags of each one in each box. Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\n",
       "3 I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente. It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.  On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi\\'s finest.\"\"  The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won\\'t be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don\\'t, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.  Highly recommended. *****'</span></li>\n",

My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they\\'d have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.  On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi\\textbackslash{}'s finest.\"\"  The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won\\textbackslash{}'t be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don\\textbackslash{}'t, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.  Highly recommended. *****'\n",

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</td></tr>\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </span></td></tr>\n",

They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\\\\\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;***** |\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

       "2 *****<br />Numi's Collection Assortment Melange includes:<br />5 Herbal Teas (caffeine-free, also called \"\"teasans\"\"):<br />* Dry Desert Lime: Lime Herbal Teasan<br />* Fields of Gold: Lemongrass Herbal Teasan<br />* Red Mellow Bush: Rooibos Herbal Teasan<br />* Bushmen's Brew: Honeybush Herbal Teasan<br />* Simply Mint: Moroccan Mint<br /><br />2 Green Teas (lower in caffeine):<br />* Temple of Heaven: Gunpowder Green Tea<br />* Monkey King: Jasmine Green Tea<br /><br />2 Black Teas (contain caffeine):<br />* Chinese Breakfast: Yunnan Black Tea<br />* Smoky Tarry: Lapsang Souchong Black Tea<br /><br />This is a total of nine different teas, two tea bags of each one in each box. Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\n",
       "3 I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente. It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "4 Buying this multi-pack I was misled by the picture with whole hazel nuts. (Another proof how important is to read). But no problem.

       "6 I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</td></tr>\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </span></td></tr>\n",

The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\\\\\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;***** |\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

The chocolate is delicious like any Lindt's chocolate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

       "2 *****<br />Numi's Collection Assortment Melange includes:<br />5 Herbal Teas (caffeine-free, also called \"\"teasans\"\"):<br />* Dry Desert Lime: Lime Herbal Teasan<br />* Fields of Gold: Lemongrass Herbal Teasan<br />* Red Mellow Bush: Rooibos Herbal Teasan<br />* Bushmen's Brew: Honeybush Herbal Teasan<br />* Simply Mint: Moroccan Mint<br /><br />2 Green Teas (lower in caffeine):<br />* Temple of Heaven: Gunpowder Green Tea<br />* Monkey King: Jasmine Green Tea<br /><br />2 Black Teas (contain caffeine):<br />* Chinese Breakfast: Yunnan Black Tea<br />* Smoky Tarry: Lapsang Souchong Black Tea<br /><br />This is a total of nine different teas, two tea bags of each one in each box. Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\n",
       "3 I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente. It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "6 I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags.

Her refried beans were very special with a smooth texture and rich flavor. These beans in the Gold bag are almost just as good without the work. My family loves them and they are so easy to make.

But this used to be one of my favorite gums when I lived in Japan. I never thought that it tasted like cough medicine. Maybe it's just an acquired taste. I also used to chew only the hard shell gum. The stick gum wasn't as good, in my opinion. I still prefer American gum over Japanese gum but it's not horrible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr>\n",

I'm relatively new to long distance running (my long runs are only 10k) and this is the first gel product I've used, but it did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's hard to credit my gains solely to this, so I will give a wrap-up of my experience and let you decide.  The first time I ran 10k, I had a time of 55:25 (I know that's slow, but I'm a bigger guy).  The second time I tried it, there were a few differences: I wore running shorts (the first time I wore basketball shorts) and I had a fuel belt equipped with a 20oz water bottle and two Strawberry Banana PowerBar Power Gel Packets; temperature and environment were similar during both runs.  Anyway, I popped these gel packs at around the 20 minute and 40 minute mark and my time dropped to 52:21!  I don't know about you, but I think an improvement of over 3 minutes is fantastic...  Especially if you consider that is nearly 30 seconds per mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I know the shorts (they were quite a bit lighter and didn't get soaked with sweat) and liquid helped quite a bit, as well as my muscles being a little more broken in from the first time I tried 10k, but the biggest thing I noticed was my consistency.  My third mile on my first run was a horrific 9:37 and way off the rest of my mile times.  During my second run, each mile ranged from around 8:17 (my 5th mile) to 8:37 (my first mile); I think the fact that my mile times improved as my run went on also illustrates the effectiveness of this product.  I track my time and distance with a Garmin Forerunner 205 (another fantastic product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I highly suggest this product if you are new to long distance running or a veteran that competes.  If you dont' want to commit to an entire box, I bought a couple of individual packets at REI for $1.25 a piece just to see if I noticed an improvement.  Compared to the other reviews, I don't think this is hard to swallow at all.  If you spray a little water in your mouth before consuming the packet, it goes down even easier.  My one and only con would be that it is kind of sticky, so if you get any on your hands it's quite annoying; small price to pay in my eyes.</span></td></tr>\n",

It was nice to have a maintenance food that all my dogs could eat. The last bag I purchased on Aug.4th smelled and looked different.  Almost immediately after feeding the dogs, my Mastiff became very ill, Bloated belly, diarrhea and lethargic.  The next day my Schnauzers became ill with the same symptoms.  I checked my bag of food and found nothing written as far as NEW FORMULA.  I cooked them all boiled chicken and rice and the symptoms went away.  I then checked on line and found many complaints about Canidae.  I am a professional dog groomer that recommended this food until now. I took my bag back the the pet store for a refund and found a better food to feed my dogs.  Canidae changing their formula cost me a vet bill for my Mastiff and a carpet cleaning bill.  I'll pass this brand by in the stores from now on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

Her refried beans were very special with a smooth texture and rich flavor. These beans in the Gold bag are almost just as good without the work. My family loves them and they are so easy to make. Since you cant come to my grandmas house I highly recommend these beans now if we could only get the same quality tortillas we would be set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\\\\n",

But this used to be one of my favorite gums when I lived in Japan. I never thought that it tasted like cough medicine. Maybe it's just an acquired taste. I also used to chew only the hard shell gum. The stick gum wasn't as good, in my opinion. I still prefer American gum over Japanese gum but it's not horrible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\\\\n",

I'm relatively new to long distance running (my long runs are only 10k) and this is the first gel product I've used, but it did not disappoint.<br /><br />It's hard to credit my gains solely to this, so I will give a wrap-up of my experience and let you decide.  The first time I ran 10k, I had a time of 55:25 (I know that's slow, but I'm a bigger guy).  The second time I tried it, there were a few differences: I wore running shorts (the first time I wore basketball shorts) and I had a fuel belt equipped with a 20oz water bottle and two Strawberry Banana PowerBar Power Gel Packets; temperature and environment were similar during both runs.  Anyway, I popped these gel packs at around the 20 minute and 40 minute mark and my time dropped to 52:21!  I don't know about you, but I think an improvement of over 3 minutes is fantastic...  Especially if you consider that is nearly 30 seconds per mile.<br /><br />Okay, so I know the shorts (they were quite a bit lighter and didn't get soaked with sweat) and liquid helped quite a bit, as well as my muscles being a little more broken in from the first time I tried 10k, but the biggest thing I noticed was my consistency.  My third mile on my first run was a horrific 9:37 and way off the rest of my mile times.  During my second run, each mile ranged from around 8:17 (my 5th mile) to 8:37 (my first mile); I think the fact that my mile times improved as my run went on also illustrates the effectiveness of this product.  I track my time and distance with a Garmin Forerunner 205 (another fantastic product).<br /><br />Anyway, I highly suggest this product if you are new to long distance running or a veteran that competes.  If you dont' want to commit to an entire box, I bought a couple of individual packets at REI for \\$1.25 a piece just to see if I noticed an improvement.  Compared to the other reviews, I don't think this is hard to swallow at all.  If you spray a little water in your mouth before consuming the packet, it goes down even easier.  My one and only con would be that it is kind of sticky, so if you get any on your hands it's quite annoying; small price to pay in my eyes.\\\\\n",

The price is comparable to the McCormick. I use alot of pepper and the bigger jar is better. This company ships FAST. Very satisfied.

It was nice to have a maintenance food that all my dogs could eat. The last bag I purchased on Aug.4th smelled and looked different.  Almost immediately after feeding the dogs, my Mastiff became very ill, Bloated belly, diarrhea and lethargic.  The next day my Schnauzers became ill with the same symptoms.  I checked my bag of food and found nothing written as far as NEW FORMULA.  I cooked them all boiled chicken and rice and the symptoms went away.  I then checked on line and found many complaints about Canidae.  I am a professional dog groomer that recommended this food until now. I took my bag back the the pet store for a refund and found a better food to feed my dogs.  Canidae changing their formula cost me a vet bill for my Mastiff and a carpet cleaning bill.  I'll pass this brand by in the stores from now on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\\\\n",

Her refried beans were very special with a smooth texture and rich flavor. These beans in the Gold bag are almost just as good without the work. My family loves them and they are so easy to make.

But this used to be one of my favorite gums when I lived in Japan. I never thought that it tasted like cough medicine. Maybe it's just an acquired taste. I also used to chew only the hard shell gum. The stick gum wasn't as good, in my opinion. I still prefer American gum over Japanese gum but it's not horrible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

I'm relatively new to long distance running (my long runs are only 10k) and this is the first gel product I've used, but it did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's hard to credit my gains solely to this, so I will give a wrap-up of my experience and let you decide.  The first time I ran 10k, I had a time of 55:25 (I know that's slow, but I'm a bigger guy).  The second time I tried it, there were a few differences: I wore running shorts (the first time I wore basketball shorts) and I had a fuel belt equipped with a 20oz water bottle and two Strawberry Banana PowerBar Power Gel Packets; temperature and environment were similar during both runs.  Anyway, I popped these gel packs at around the 20 minute and 40 minute mark and my time dropped to 52:21!  I don't know about you, but I think an improvement of over 3 minutes is fantastic...  Especially if you consider that is nearly 30 seconds per mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I know the shorts (they were quite a bit lighter and didn't get soaked with sweat) and liquid helped quite a bit, as well as my muscles being a little more broken in from the first time I tried 10k, but the biggest thing I noticed was my consistency.  My third mile on my first run was a horrific 9:37 and way off the rest of my mile times.  During my second run, each mile ranged from around 8:17 (my 5th mile) to 8:37 (my first mile); I think the fact that my mile times improved as my run went on also illustrates the effectiveness of this product.  I track my time and distance with a Garmin Forerunner 205 (another fantastic product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I highly suggest this product if you are new to long distance running or a veteran that competes.  If you dont' want to commit to an entire box, I bought a couple of individual packets at REI for $1.25 a piece just to see if I noticed an improvement.  Compared to the other reviews, I don't think this is hard to swallow at all.  If you spray a little water in your mouth before consuming the packet, it goes down even easier.  My one and only con would be that it is kind of sticky, so if you get any on your hands it's quite annoying; small price to pay in my eyes. |\n",

It was nice to have a maintenance food that all my dogs could eat. The last bag I purchased on Aug.4th smelled and looked different.  Almost immediately after feeding the dogs, my Mastiff became very ill, Bloated belly, diarrhea and lethargic.  The next day my Schnauzers became ill with the same symptoms.  I checked my bag of food and found nothing written as far as NEW FORMULA.  I cooked them all boiled chicken and rice and the symptoms went away.  I then checked on line and found many complaints about Canidae.  I am a professional dog groomer that recommended this food until now. I took my bag back the the pet store for a refund and found a better food to feed my dogs.  Canidae changing their formula cost me a vet bill for my Mastiff and a carpet cleaning bill.  I'll pass this brand by in the stores from now on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

       "426335 Growing up in the southwest refried beans were a staple in our home and anytime we went to my grandmothers house we were always excited to eat a bean burrito on fresh made flour tortillas. Her refried beans were very special with a smooth texture and rich flavor. These beans in the Gold bag are almost just as good without the work. My family loves them and they are so easy to make. Since you cant come to my grandmas house I highly recommend these beans now if we could only get the same quality tortillas we would be set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "426336 Like a lot of the gums by Lotte, the flavor doesn't last too long. But this used to be one of my favorite gums when I lived in Japan. I never thought that it tasted like cough medicine. Maybe it's just an acquired taste. I also used to chew only the hard shell gum. The stick gum wasn't as good, in my opinion. I still prefer American gum over Japanese gum but it's not horrible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "426337 This is a fantastic product.  I'm relatively new to long distance running (my long runs are only 10k) and this is the first gel product I've used, but it did not disappoint.<br /><br />It's hard to credit my gains solely to this, so I will give a wrap-up of my experience and let you decide.  The first time I ran 10k, I had a time of 55:25 (I know that's slow, but I'm a bigger guy).  The second time I tried it, there were a few differences: I wore running shorts (the first time I wore basketball shorts) and I had a fuel belt equipped with a 20oz water bottle and two Strawberry Banana PowerBar Power Gel Packets; temperature and environment were similar during both runs.  Anyway, I popped these gel packs at around the 20 minute and 40 minute mark and my time dropped to 52:21!  I don't know about you, but I think an improvement of over 3 minutes is fantastic...  Especially if you consider that is nearly 30 seconds per mile.<br /><br />Okay, so I know the shorts (they were quite a bit lighter and didn't get soaked with sweat) and liquid helped quite a bit, as well as my muscles being a little more broken in from the first time I tried 10k, but the biggest thing I noticed was my consistency.  My third mile on my first run was a horrific 9:37 and way off the rest of my mile times.  During my second run, each mile ranged from around 8:17 (my 5th mile) to 8:37 (my first mile); I think the fact that my mile times improved as my run went on also illustrates the effectiveness of this product.  I track my time and distance with a Garmin Forerunner 205 (another fantastic product).<br /><br />Anyway, I highly suggest this product if you are new to long distance running or a veteran that competes.  If you dont' want to commit to an entire box, I bought a couple of individual packets at REI for $1.25 a piece just to see if I noticed an improvement.  Compared to the other reviews, I don't think this is hard to swallow at all.  If you spray a little water in your mouth before consuming the packet, it goes down even easier.  My one and only con would be that it is kind of sticky, so if you get any on your hands it's quite annoying; small price to pay in my eyes.\n",
       "426338 I trust this brand--the flavors are blended just right and I love that many formulas include stevia--no need to add sweetener!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "426339 This pepper is great! I was buying McCormick, but couldn't find it anymore. This pepper has a slightly smoky flavor. Just what I wanted. The grind is perfect, not too fine or chunky. The price is comparable to the McCormick. I use alot of pepper and the bigger jar is better. This company ships FAST. Very satisfied.

       "426340 I have relied on Canidae for my 4 dogs for over 3 years now. It was nice to have a maintenance food that all my dogs could eat. The last bag I purchased on Aug.4th smelled and looked different.  Almost immediately after feeding the dogs, my Mastiff became very ill, Bloated belly, diarrhea and lethargic.  The next day my Schnauzers became ill with the same symptoms.  I checked my bag of food and found nothing written as far as NEW FORMULA.  I cooked them all boiled chicken and rice and the symptoms went away.  I then checked on line and found many complaints about Canidae.  I am a professional dog groomer that recommended this food until now. I took my bag back the the pet store for a refund and found a better food to feed my dogs.  Canidae changing their formula cost me a vet bill for my Mastiff and a carpet cleaning bill.  I'll pass this brand by in the stores from now on.

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</td></tr>\n",

I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </span></td></tr>\n",

What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\\\\\n",
       "\t B000LKTB90 & A1BBPP1EC75JX4 & 0 & 0 & 5 & 1285977600 & excellent gluten-free spaghetti: great taste, great structure & I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente. It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;***** |\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

       "2 *****<br />Numi's Collection Assortment Melange includes:<br />5 Herbal Teas (caffeine-free, also called \"\"teasans\"\"):<br />* Dry Desert Lime: Lime Herbal Teasan<br />* Fields of Gold: Lemongrass Herbal Teasan<br />* Red Mellow Bush: Rooibos Herbal Teasan<br />* Bushmen's Brew: Honeybush Herbal Teasan<br />* Simply Mint: Moroccan Mint<br /><br />2 Green Teas (lower in caffeine):<br />* Temple of Heaven: Gunpowder Green Tea<br />* Monkey King: Jasmine Green Tea<br /><br />2 Black Teas (contain caffeine):<br />* Chinese Breakfast: Yunnan Black Tea<br />* Smoky Tarry: Lapsang Souchong Black Tea<br /><br />This is a total of nine different teas, two tea bags of each one in each box. Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\n",
       "3 I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente. It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "4 Buying this multi-pack I was misled by the picture with whole hazel nuts. (Another proof how important is to read). But no problem.

       "6 I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags.

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</td></tr>\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </span></td></tr>\n",

What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\\\\\n",
       "\t B000LKTB90 & A1BBPP1EC75JX4 & 0 & 0 & 5 & 1285977600 & excellent gluten-free spaghetti: great taste, great structure & I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente. It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;***** |\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

       "2 *****<br />Numi's Collection Assortment Melange includes:<br />5 Herbal Teas (caffeine-free, also called \"\"teasans\"\"):<br />* Dry Desert Lime: Lime Herbal Teasan<br />* Fields of Gold: Lemongrass Herbal Teasan<br />* Red Mellow Bush: Rooibos Herbal Teasan<br />* Bushmen's Brew: Honeybush Herbal Teasan<br />* Simply Mint: Moroccan Mint<br /><br />2 Green Teas (lower in caffeine):<br />* Temple of Heaven: Gunpowder Green Tea<br />* Monkey King: Jasmine Green Tea<br /><br />2 Black Teas (contain caffeine):<br />* Chinese Breakfast: Yunnan Black Tea<br />* Smoky Tarry: Lapsang Souchong Black Tea<br /><br />This is a total of nine different teas, two tea bags of each one in each box. Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\n",
       "3 I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente. It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "4 Buying this multi-pack I was misled by the picture with whole hazel nuts. (Another proof how important is to read). But no problem.

       "6 I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags.

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</td></tr>\n",

My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente).

The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\\\\\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;***** |\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente).

The chocolate is delicious like any Lindt's chocolate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

       "2 *****<br />Numi's Collection Assortment Melange includes:<br />5 Herbal Teas (caffeine-free, also called \"\"teasans\"\"):<br />* Dry Desert Lime: Lime Herbal Teasan<br />* Fields of Gold: Lemongrass Herbal Teasan<br />* Red Mellow Bush: Rooibos Herbal Teasan<br />* Bushmen's Brew: Honeybush Herbal Teasan<br />* Simply Mint: Moroccan Mint<br /><br />2 Green Teas (lower in caffeine):<br />* Temple of Heaven: Gunpowder Green Tea<br />* Monkey King: Jasmine Green Tea<br /><br />2 Black Teas (contain caffeine):<br />* Chinese Breakfast: Yunnan Black Tea<br />* Smoky Tarry: Lapsang Souchong Black Tea<br /><br />This is a total of nine different teas, two tea bags of each one in each box. Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\n",
       "3 I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente. It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "6 I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</td></tr>\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </span></td></tr>\n",

The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\\\\\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;***** |\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

The chocolate is delicious like any Lindt's chocolate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

       "2 *****<br />Numi's Collection Assortment Melange includes:<br />5 Herbal Teas (caffeine-free, also called \"\"teasans\"\"):<br />* Dry Desert Lime: Lime Herbal Teasan<br />* Fields of Gold: Lemongrass Herbal Teasan<br />* Red Mellow Bush: Rooibos Herbal Teasan<br />* Bushmen's Brew: Honeybush Herbal Teasan<br />* Simply Mint: Moroccan Mint<br /><br />2 Green Teas (lower in caffeine):<br />* Temple of Heaven: Gunpowder Green Tea<br />* Monkey King: Jasmine Green Tea<br /><br />2 Black Teas (contain caffeine):<br />* Chinese Breakfast: Yunnan Black Tea<br />* Smoky Tarry: Lapsang Souchong Black Tea<br /><br />This is a total of nine different teas, two tea bags of each one in each box. Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\n",
       "3 I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente. It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "6 I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</td></tr>\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </span></td></tr>\n",

The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\\\\\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;***** |\n",

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

The chocolate is delicious like any Lindt's chocolate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

       "2 *****<br />Numi's Collection Assortment Melange includes:<br />5 Herbal Teas (caffeine-free, also called \"\"teasans\"\"):<br />* Dry Desert Lime: Lime Herbal Teasan<br />* Fields of Gold: Lemongrass Herbal Teasan<br />* Red Mellow Bush: Rooibos Herbal Teasan<br />* Bushmen's Brew: Honeybush Herbal Teasan<br />* Simply Mint: Moroccan Mint<br /><br />2 Green Teas (lower in caffeine):<br />* Temple of Heaven: Gunpowder Green Tea<br />* Monkey King: Jasmine Green Tea<br /><br />2 Black Teas (contain caffeine):<br />* Chinese Breakfast: Yunnan Black Tea<br />* Smoky Tarry: Lapsang Souchong Black Tea<br /><br />This is a total of nine different teas, two tea bags of each one in each box. Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\n",
       "3 I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente. It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "6 I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.

I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.  This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.  This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!  This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & excellent gluten-free spaghetti: great taste, great structure I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente.

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.  This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!  This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | excellent gluten-free spaghetti: great taste, great structure I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente.

       "2 ***** Numi's Collection Assortment Melange includes: 5 Herbal Teas (caffeine-free, also called \"\"teasans\"\"): * Dry Desert Lime: Lime Herbal Teasan * Fields of Gold: Lemongrass Herbal Teasan * Red Mellow Bush: Rooibos Herbal Teasan * Bushmen's Brew: Honeybush Herbal Teasan * Simply Mint: Moroccan Mint  2 Green Teas (lower in caffeine): * Temple of Heaven: Gunpowder Green Tea * Monkey King: Jasmine Green Tea  2 Black Teas (contain caffeine): * Chinese Breakfast: Yunnan Black Tea * Smoky Tarry: Lapsang Souchong Black Tea  This is a total of nine different teas, two tea bags of each one in each box. Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.  On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"  The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.  Highly recommended. *****\n",
       "3 I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente. It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.  This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!  This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "6 I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "2 Organic, Kosher, Tasty Assortment of Premium Teas & Teasans ***** Numi's Collection Assortment Melange includes: 5 Herbal Teas (caffeine-free, also called \"\"teasans\"\"): * Dry Desert Lime: Lime Herbal Teasan * Fields of Gold: Lemongrass Herbal Teasan * Red Mellow Bush: Rooibos Herbal Teasan * Bushmen's Brew: Honeybush Herbal Teasan * Simply Mint: Moroccan Mint  2 Green Teas (lower in caffeine): * Temple of Heaven: Gunpowder Green Tea * Monkey King: Jasmine Green Tea  2 Black Teas (contain caffeine): * Chinese Breakfast: Yunnan Black Tea * Smoky Tarry: Lapsang Souchong Black Tea  This is a total of nine different teas, two tea bags of each one in each box. Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.  On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"  The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.  Highly recommended. *****\n",
       "3 excellent gluten-free spaghetti: great taste, great structure I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente. It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.  This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!  This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "6 Delicious I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.

I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.  This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.  This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!  This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & excellent gluten-free spaghetti: great taste, great structure I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente.

It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.  This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!  This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | excellent gluten-free spaghetti: great taste, great structure I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente.

       "2 ***** Numi's Collection Assortment Melange includes: 5 Herbal Teas (caffeine-free, also called \"\"teasans\"\"): * Dry Desert Lime: Lime Herbal Teasan * Fields of Gold: Lemongrass Herbal Teasan * Red Mellow Bush: Rooibos Herbal Teasan * Bushmen's Brew: Honeybush Herbal Teasan * Simply Mint: Moroccan Mint  2 Green Teas (lower in caffeine): * Temple of Heaven: Gunpowder Green Tea * Monkey King: Jasmine Green Tea  2 Black Teas (contain caffeine): * Chinese Breakfast: Yunnan Black Tea * Smoky Tarry: Lapsang Souchong Black Tea  This is a total of nine different teas, two tea bags of each one in each box. Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.  On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"  The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.  Highly recommended. *****\n",
       "3 I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente. It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.  This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!  This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "2 Organic, Kosher, Tasty Assortment of Premium Teas & Teasans ***** Numi's Collection Assortment Melange includes: 5 Herbal Teas (caffeine-free, also called \"\"teasans\"\"): * Dry Desert Lime: Lime Herbal Teasan * Fields of Gold: Lemongrass Herbal Teasan * Red Mellow Bush: Rooibos Herbal Teasan * Bushmen's Brew: Honeybush Herbal Teasan * Simply Mint: Moroccan Mint  2 Green Teas (lower in caffeine): * Temple of Heaven: Gunpowder Green Tea * Monkey King: Jasmine Green Tea  2 Black Teas (contain caffeine): * Chinese Breakfast: Yunnan Black Tea * Smoky Tarry: Lapsang Souchong Black Tea  This is a total of nine different teas, two tea bags of each one in each box. Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.  On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"\"From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.\"\"  The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.  Highly recommended. *****\n",
       "3 excellent gluten-free spaghetti: great taste, great structure I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente. It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.  This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"\"grains\"\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!  This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "4 Lindt is Lindt Buying this multi-pack I was misled by the picture with whole hazel nuts. (Another proof how important is to read). But no problem. The chocolate is delicious like any Lindt's chocolate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "6 Delicious I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.
