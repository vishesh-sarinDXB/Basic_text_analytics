Khannah-Brown""",1,1,5,1190160000,"Organic, Kosher, Tasty Assortment of Premium Teas & Teasans","*****<br />Numi's Collection Assortment Melange includes:<br />5 Herbal Teas (caffeine-free, also called ""teasans""):<br />* Dry Desert Lime: Lime Herbal Teasan<br />* Fields of Gold: Lemongrass Herbal Teasan<br />* Red Mellow Bush: Rooibos Herbal Teasan<br />* Bushmen's Brew: Honeybush Herbal Teasan<br />* Simply Mint: Moroccan Mint<br /><br />2 Green Teas (lower in caffeine):<br />* Temple of Heaven: Gunpowder Green Tea<br />* Monkey King: Jasmine Green Tea<br /><br />2 Black Teas (contain caffeine):<br />* Chinese Breakfast: Yunnan Black Tea<br />* Smoky Tarry: Lapsang Souchong Black Tea<br /><br />This is a total of nine different teas, two tea bags of each one in each box. Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: ""From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.""<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
